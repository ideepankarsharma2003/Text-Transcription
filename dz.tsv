0	6200	The following is a conversation with Jan LeCun, his second time on the podcast.
6200	14280	He is the chief AI scientist at Meta, formerly Facebook, professor at NYU, touring award
14280	19220	winner, one of the seminal figures in the history of machine learning and artificial
19220	25700	intelligence, and someone who is brilliant and opinionated in the best kind of way, and
25700	27060	so is always fun to talk to.
27060	29720	So, this is a Lex Friedman podcast.
29900	32520	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
33220	36740	And now, here's my conversation with Jan LeCun.
38460	43240	You co-wrote the article, Self-Supervised Learning, The Dark Matter of Intelligence.
43620	45800	Great title, by the way, with Ishan Mizra.
46260	51840	So let me ask, what is self-supervised learning, and why is it the dark matter of intelligence?
53900	55800	I'll start by the dark matter part.
57060	65320	There is obviously a kind of learning that humans and animals are doing that we currently
65320	68920	are not reproducing properly with machines, with AI, right?
69000	73660	So the most popular approaches to machine learning today are, or paradigms, I should
73660	75920	say, are supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
76980	78720	And they are extremely inefficient.
79600	85520	Supervised learning requires many samples for learning anything, and reinforcement learning
85520	86940	requires a ridiculously large amount of time.
87060	91320	There's a large number of trial and errors for a system to learn anything.
94380	96280	And that's why we don't have self-driving cars.
98240	100020	That's a big leap from one to the other.
100440	108060	Okay, so to solve difficult problems, you have to have a lot of human annotation for
108060	109160	supervised learning to work.
109640	113740	And to solve those difficult problems with reinforcement learning, you have to have some
113740	116740	way to maybe simulate that problem such that you can do that large-scale.
117060	119660	Kind of learning that reinforcement learning requires.
120040	120120	Right.
121720	122160	Right.
122320	127540	So how is it that, you know, most teenagers can learn to drive a car in about 20
